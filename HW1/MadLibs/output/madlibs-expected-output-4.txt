Your Mad Lib story:
Our American universities offer students many pretty 
courses that will prepare them to become professional water bottles.
You can get a degree as a Bachelor of oranges or take a 
regular liberal laptops course. Or, if you want to become 
a true bright red engineer, you can study awesome mathematics 
and differential paperclips. Then, after 7 years, if 
you want to continue your studies you can write your couch and 
become a Doctor of earrings.

When you get out into the dark world, if you have a diploma  
from a university, you will be able to get the job of executive assistant easily,
or perhaps even personal trainer. If you don't have a diploma, you may have to settle
for the job title of "pinky toe".

Remember, it's important that you study hard in high school so you are able  
to do well on your college entrance twigs. It is true that "a little  
learning is a very plastic thing."
