Your Mad Lib story:
Barack Obama has announced that his sleepy
clothing store in the heart of downtown Timbuktu is having
the most lazy sale of all merchandise, including
pudgy suits and slightly irregular spleens
available. Men's knit bazookas, only $15.99.
Hand-woven Italian Star Wars action figures, 1/2-price. Double-
breasted cashmere toilets, $50.00. Genuine imported
pink greasy shoes, itchy handerchiefs,
and women's embroidered laptops, all at rock-bottom prices.
This is a chance to get some really crappy bargains.
