			<div><div class="howtorunsamplesolution clicktoshow" rel="How to run it?" style="opacity: 1;">
<h3 id="howtorunsamplesolution" class="faqheading">"How do I run the assignment solution demos?"</h3>

<p>
	<!--
	You can run our sample solutions two ways: on your machine as a downloadable program "JAR", or in your browser as an "applet".
	We recommend trying the JAR first.
	-->
	Our assignments offer a solution 'demo' that you can run to see the program's expected behavior.
	On many machines, all you have to do is download the .jar file, then double-click it to run it.
	But on some Macs, it won't work; your operating system will say that it doesn't know how to launch the file.
	If you have that issue, download the file, go to the Downloads folder in your Finder, right-click on the file, and click Open, and then press Confirm.
</p>

<p>
	Some Mac users see a security error such as, "cs106x-life-demo.jar can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer."
	To fix this, go to System Preferences → Security &amp; Privacy.
	You will see a section about downloaded apps.
	You should see a prompt asking if you would like to allow access to our solution JAR.
	Follow the steps and then you should be able to open the demo.
	<!--
	System Preferences &rarr; Java, and whitelisting the web site <strong>https://web.stanford.edu</strong> .
	If you see this security error message, you can try to follow <a class="popup" href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/jcp_security.xml">these instructions</a> about reducing your security restrictions for running Java applets.
	-->
</p>

<p>
	If all else fails, you could run the demo JAR from a terminal.
	Every operating system allows you to open a "terminal" or "console" window for typing raw system commands.
	Open your operating system's terminal or console window (Google if you need to learn how to do this),
	and then type:
</p>

<pre class="terminal">cd <em>DIRECTORY_WHERE_DEMO_JAR_IS_STORED</em>
java -jar <em>JAR_FILE_NAME</em>
</pre>

<p>
	For example, on a Mac machine, if your user name is jsmith12 and you have saved a demo JAR named hw1.jar in your Documents/106a directory, you would type:
</p>

<pre class="terminal">cd /users/jsmith12/Documents/106a
java -jar hw1.jar
</pre>

<p>
	Or on a Windows machine, if your user name is jsmith12 and you have saved a demo JAR named hw1.jar in your Documents/106a directory, you would type:
</p>

<pre class="terminal">cd C:\users\jsmith12\Documents\106a
java -jar hw1.jar

<h2 id="description">Program Description:</h2>

<p>
	"Mad Libs" are short stories that have blanks called placeholders to be filled in.
	In the non-computerized version of this game, one person asks a second person to fill in each of the placeholders without the second person knowing the overall story.
	(For example, "Tell me a noun: ___")
	Once all placeholders are filled in, the second person is shown the resulting story, often with humorous results.
</p>

<p>
	In this assignment you prompt the user to enter a file name representing a Mad Lib story to be filled in, re-prompting until the user types the name of a file that exists.
	Then the program reads the input file, prompting the user to fill in any placeholders that are found without showing the user the rest of the story.
	Once the user has filled in all of the placeholders, the entire completed story is shown.
</p>


<h2 id="logs">Example Logs of Execution:</h2>

Your Mad Lib story:
One of the most silly characters in fiction is named
"Tarzan of the apples." Tarzan was raised by an old
frisbee and lives in the hungry jungle in the
heart of darkest San Jose. He spends most of his time
eating bees and swinging from tree to umbrella.
Whenever he gets angry, he beats on his chest and says,
"burp!" This is his war cry. Tarzan always dresses in
shiny shorts made from the skin of his jelly donut
and his best friend is the beautiful chimpanzee named
Cheetah. He is supposed to be able to speak to elephants and
spoons. In the movies, Tarzan is played by Keanu Reeves.

<h2 id="inputfiles">Input Files:</h2>

<p>
	The starter project contains several Mad Lib input files.
	These input files are mostly just plain text, but they may also contain placeholders.
	Placeholders are represented as ranges of characters that begin with &lt; and end with &gt;.
	For example, the file <span class="filename">tarzan.txt</span> used in the previous log contains the following text.
	Placeholders are <span class="placeholder">colored</span> for emphasis.

	<pre class="inputfile">One of the most <span class="placeholder">&lt;adjective&gt;</span> characters in fiction is named
"Tarzan of the <span class="placeholder">&lt;plural noun&gt;</span>." Tarzan was raised by an old
<span class="placeholder">&lt;noun&gt;</span> and lives in the <span class="placeholder">&lt;adjective&gt;</span> jungle in the
heart of darkest <span class="placeholder">&lt;place&gt;</span>. He spends most of his time

<span class="placeholder">&lt;plural noun&gt;</span>. In the movies, Tarzan is played by <span class="placeholder">&lt;person's name&gt;</span>.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="caption">Contents of input file <span class="filename">tarzan.txt</span></div>

<p>
	Your program should break the input into lines so that you can look for all its placeholders.
	Each placeholder token in the document causes the user to be prompted.
	A placeholder could contain any number of words or characters inside it between the &lt; and &gt; characters.
	The user's response to the prompt is inserted into the eventual output rather than the placeholder itself.
	You should accept whatever response the user gives, even a multi-word answer or blank answer.
	Your output Mad Lib story must retain the original spacing and placement of line breaks from the input story file.
	If the input file contains no placeholders, just output its contents.
</p>

<p>
	When prompting the user to fill in a placeholder, give a different prompt depending on whether the placeholder begins with a vowel (a, e, i, o, or u, case-insensitively).
	If so, prompt for a response using "an".
	If not, use "a".
	For example, <code>&lt;noun&gt;</code> leads to "Please type a noun" while <code>&lt;adjective&gt;</code> leads to "Please type an adjective".
</p>

<p>
	You may assume that a placeholder will appear entirely on a single line; no placeholder will ever span across multiple lines.
	Notice that more than one placeholder might appear on the same line.
	A given line could have <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> characters in it that are not part of placeholders, and these should be retained and included in the output.
	You may assume that a placeholder token will contain at least one character between its <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code>.
	This means that you won't see a token with multiple placeholders right next to each other with no spaces between, such as <code>"&lt;noun&gt;&lt;noun&gt;&lt;noun&gt;"</code>.
	(In other words, no file will contain the token <code>&lt;&gt;</code>).
	You may also assume that no placeholder will contain a <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code> character inside it, other than the ones that mark the start and the end of the placeholder.
	Lastly, you may assume that no two placeholders will appear next to each other without any blank spaces between them, such as <code>&lt;noun&gt;&lt;noun&gt;&lt;noun&gt;</code> .
</p>


<h2 id="implementation">Implementation Details:</h2>

<p>
	Your program will be graded on functionality and style.
	To achieve a high functionality score, test your program thoroughly with the provided input files and your own test inputs.
	Here are some specific details about our expectations for your implementation:
</p>

<p>
	<em>Collections:</em> You are forbidden from using collections (e.g. <code>Vector</code>, <code>Grid</code>, <code>Map</code>, etc.) on this program.
	They are not needed, and we want you to practice manipulating strings and file streams rather than collections on this problem.
</p>

<p>
	<em>I/O:</em>
	Your program has a console-based user interface.
	You should pop up the Stanford graphical console by including <code>"console.h"</code> (<a class="popup" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/console.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>) in your program.
	Produce console output using <code>cout</code> and read console input using <code>cin</code>.
	You may use the Stanford C++ library's console-related functions such as <code>getLine</code> (uppercase L) and <code>promptUserForFile</code> to help you read from the console.
	See <code>simpio.h</code> (<a class="popup" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/simpio.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>) for more details.
</p>

<p>
	You will also write code for reading input files.
	Read a file using an <code>ifstream</code> object (<a class="popup" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/fstream/ifstream/" target="_blank">documentation</a>), along with functions such as <code>getline</code> (lowercase L) to read lines from the file.
	You may use the Stanford C++ library's file-related functions such as <code>fileExists</code> to help you read files.
	See <code>filelib.h</code> (<a class="popup" href="http://web.stanford.edu/~stepp/cppdoc/filelib.html" target="_blank">documentation</a>) for more details.
	We prefer for you to write a line-based or word-based solution, not a single-<code>char</code>-based solution (e.g. one based on (<code>input.get()</code> or similar).
	Make sure to close your input file streams when done reading.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Strings:</em> A non-trivial part of the program involves string manipulation.
	You may want to look up members of the C++ <code>string</code> class (<a class="popup" href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/string/" target="_blank">documentation</a>) such as <code>find</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>substr</code>, and so on.
</p>


<h2 id="creative">Creative Aspect, <span class="filename">mymadlib.txt</span>:</h2>

<p>
	Along with your code, submit a file <span class="filename">mymadlib.txt</span> with a story of your own creation, suitable for use as input to your program.
	This is worth a small part of your grade.
	For full credit, your story should be at least 8 lines long and at least five (5) placeholders, and should not be extremely similar to an existing input file.
</p>


<h2 id="style">Style Details:</h2>

<p>
	To achieve a high style score, submit a program with high code quality that conforms to the guidelines presented in our course.
	There are many general C++ coding styles that you should follow, such as naming, indentation, commenting, avoiding redundancy, etc.
	While there are many valid programming styles in various contexts, the most important overall stylistic trait a programmer can have is the ability to be given a set of style guidelines and follow them rigorously and consistently.
	In the context of this course, our style guides and constraints are the laws of the land and are not open for debate.
</p>

<p>
	Before getting started, you should read our <a class="popup" href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106x/cs106x.1182/styleguide.shtml" target="_blank"><strong>Style Guide</strong></a> for information about expected coding style.
	You are expected to follow the Style Guide on all homework code.
	The following are some points of emphasis and style contraints specific to this problem:
</p>

<p>
	<em>C++ idioms:</em>
	For full credit, you must use C++ facilities (<code>cout</code>, <code>ifstream</code>, <code>string</code>) instead of C equivalents (<code>printf</code>, <code>fopen</code>, <code>char*</code>).
</p>

<p>
	<em>Procedural decomposition:</em>
	Your <code>main</code> function should represent a concise summary of the overall program.
	It is okay for <code>main</code> to contain some code, such as calls to other functions or brief console output statements to <code>cout</code>.
	But <code>main</code> should not perform too large a share of the overall work itself directly, such as reading the lines of the input file or prompting the user to replace placeholders.
	Instead, it should make calls to other functions to help it achieve the overall goal.
	You should declare <strong>function prototypes</strong> (each function's header followed by a semicolon) near the top of your file for all functions besides <code>main</code>, regardless of whether this is necessary for the program to compile.
</p>

<p>
	Each function should perform a single clear and coherent task.
	No one function should do too large a share of the overall work.
	As a rough estimate, a function whose body (excluding the header and closing brace) has more than 30 lines is likely too large.
	You should avoid "chaining" long sequences of function calls together without coming back to <code>main</code>, as described in the Procedural Design Heuristics handout on the course web site.
	Your functions should also be used to help you avoid <strong>redundant code</strong>.
	If you are performing identical or very similar commands repeatedly, factor out the common code and logic into a helper function, or otherwise remove the redundancy.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Parameters, Returns, Values, References:</em>
	Since your program will have several functions and those functions will want to share information, you will need to appropriately pass parameters and/or return values between the functions.
	Each function's parameters and return values should be well chosen.
	Do not declare unnecessary parameters that are not needed by your function.
	A particular point of emphasis on this assignment is that you should demonstrate that you understand when it is proper to <strong>pass by reference</strong>, and when it is proper for a parameter to be declared <strong><code>const</code></strong>.
	You should also demonstrate that you understand when it is better to return a result and when it is better to store a result into an 'output' reference parameter.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Variables and types:</em>
	Use descriptive variable and function names.
	Use appropriate data types for each variable and parameter; for example, do not use a <code>double</code> if the variable is intended to hold an integer, and do not use an <code>int</code> if the variable is storing a <code>true</code>/<code>false</code> state that would be better suited to a <code>bool</code>.
	When manipulating strings, favor talking to <code>string</code> objects over individual <code>char</code> values when possible, and use the <code>string</code> object's built-in methods as opposed to rewriting similar behavior yourself.
	Do not declare any global variables or <code>static</code> variables; every variable in your program must be declared inside one of your functions and must exist in only that scope.
	No single variable's scope should extend beyond a single invocation of a single function.
</p>

<p>
	<em>Commenting:</em>
	Your code should have adequate commenting.
	The top of your file should have a descriptive comment header with your name, a description of the assignment, and a citation of all sources you used to help you write your program.
	Each function should have a comment header describing that function's behavior, any parameters it accepts and any values it returns, and any assumptions the function makes about how it will be used.
	For larger functions, you should also place a brief inline comment on any complex sections of code to explain what the code is doing.
	See the programs written in lecture or the Course Style Guide for examples of proper commenting.

		This assignment is an individual assignment, so you should work individually and submit your own solution.
		Do not show your code to any other student and do not develop your solution with a partner.
	</dd>

	<dt id="wordsinplaceholder">
		Q: How many words can be part of a placeholder?  Can I assume some maximum value?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: You shouldn't assume any maximum.  A placeholder of <code>&lt;hi how are you I am fine OK bye&gt;</code> would be valid and should work in your program.
	</dd>

	<dt id="qtcreator">
		Q: You said I need to use Qt Creator to write my homework, but I prefer a different editor (Visual Studio, Xcode, Eclipse, Netbeans, vim, emacs, etc.).
		Can I use my favorite editor instead of Qt Creator?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Probably not.
		We don't support this.
		We are giving you out a starter project in Qt Creator's format, so if you were trying to use a different editor, you'd have to disassemble that starter project and put it back together in your editor's format, which might be difficult.
		Also, if you have any problems getting things to work in your editor, we will not be willing to help you fix them.
	</dd>

	<dt id="qtcreatorfail">
		Q: I'm having trouble getting Qt Creator to work!  Help!
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Please make sure you followed the instructions in our <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106x/cs106x.1182/qt-creator.shtml">Qt Creator</a> page.
		If you are still having trouble, please see our <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106x/cs106x.1182/qt-creator-troubleshooting.shtml">Tricky C++ Issues</a> page for some possible solutions.
	</dd>

	<dt id="permissiondenied">
		Q: When I try to compile my program I see an error message, "cannot open output file ...\MadLibs.exe: Permission denied".
		What does it mean?
		How do I fix it?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: It means that your Life executable is still running from the last time you ran/tested the program a moment ago.
		Make sure to shut down any previously running instances of your program.
		Click Qt Creator's "3 Application Output" tab and click any of the red square "stop" sign buttons you see.
		You might also need to open your operating system's Task Manager to stop them all.
	</dd>

	<dt id="advancedmaterial">
		Q: I already know a lot of C/C++ from my previous programming experience.
		Can I use advanced features, such as pointers, on this assignment?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: No; you should limit yourself to using the material that was taught in class so far.
	</dd>

	<dt id="files">
		Q: Can I add any other files to the program, other than <code>madlibs.cpp</code>?
		Can I add some classes to the program?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: No; you should limit yourself to <code>madlibs.cpp</code> and functions defined in that file.
	</dd>

	<dt id="fileiocharbychar">
		Q: I am having trouble reading the file character-by-character.
		How do I detect the line endings and how do I know how many characters to read?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: We don't recommend reading the file character-by-character.
		Instead, repeatedly call <code>getline</code> on the file and then process that entire line.
	</dd>

	<dt id="fileio">
		Q: I am having trouble reading the input files.
		It always crashes with a "file not found" error.
		What is wrong?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Remember that the input files are in the same directory as your program, so if the user types <code>"foo.txt"</code> you need to open <code>"foo.txt"</code> in your code with no path or directory name in front of the file name.
		The grid input files should be found in the starter ZIP file in the <code>res</code> subdirectory of the overall project.
		That's also where you can put your own custom <code>mymadlib.txt</code> file later when you make it.
	</dd>

	<dt id="symbolnotfounderror">
		Q: What does this error mean?

<pre>error: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
</pre>
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: This can happen when you are trying to call a function that you have not declared, or call a function with the wrong parameters.
		Remember that you need to declare function prototypes (the function's name and parameters followed by a semicolon) at the top of your program for <code>main</code> to be able to see them.

		<p>
			Try clicking the "4 Compiler Output" tab button near the bottom of Qt Creator and reading the detailed output about exactly what symbol was not defined.
		</p>
	</dd>

	<dt id="passifstream">
		Q: Why can't I pass an <code>ifstream</code> file input stream as a parameter?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: You must pass it by reference.
	</dd>
	<dt id="pregrade">
		Q: Will my solution get full credit?
		Is it written in the style you want?
		Will I get marked off for this code?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: In general we cannot answer these kinds of questions.
		We call this "pre-grading."
		The section leader/TA/instructor can't look over your entire program for mistakes or tell you exactly what things you will get marked off for; we don't have the resources to provide such a service, and even if we did, we want you to learn how to gain these intuitions on your own.
		We'll grade you on the guidelines in the homework document, and we can help you with specific issues and questions about your code, but we cannot pre-evaluate your entire program for you or give you advance warning about every possible mistake or violation.
	</dd>

	<dt id="creativeindex">
		Q: Is my <code>mymadlib.txt</code> file okay?
		Will it get full credit?
	</dt>
	<dd>
		A: Our grading is pretty lenient on a creative part aspect like this.
		If it meets the criteria in the assignment spec, it should get full credit, even if it is not particularly creative or exciting.
